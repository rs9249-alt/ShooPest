# 🌱 ShooPest – Smart Drone, Healthy Crops, Safe Future 🚀

ShooPest is an AI-powered drone-based pesticide spraying system that detects plant diseases and pest infections in real time and sprays pesticides **only where needed**. This precision approach reduces chemical waste, lowers costs, and supports sustainable agriculture.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Traditional farming relies on blanket pesticide spraying, which:
- Wastes chemicals
- Increases farming costs
- Harms soil, water, and human health

Farmers also struggle to detect infections early, leading to reduced crop yield.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
ShooPest uses a **drone-mounted camera and AI model** to:
- Capture aerial images of crops
- Detect infected plants and severity levels
- Calculate the exact pesticide dosage
- Perform **variable-rate spraying** only on affected zones

---

## ✨ Key Features
- AI-based pest & disease detection (CNN model)
- Precision spraying based on infection severity
- Reduced pesticide usage (30–50%)
- GPS-based targeted spraying
- Environment-friendly and cost-effective

---

## 🛠️ Core Components
- **ESP32-CAM / RGB Camera** – Captures crop images
- **AI Model (CNN)** – Detects disease type & severity
- **GPS Module** – Maps infected areas
- **Microcontroller (ESP32 / Raspberry Pi)** – Controls logic
- **Sprayer System** – Pump, solenoid valve, servo nozzles
- **Environmental Sensors** – Humidity, temperature, soil moisture

---

## ⚙️ Technical Workflow
1. Drone flight over farmland  
2. Geo-tagged image capture  
3. AI analysis of infection & severity  
4. Heatmap generation & dose calculation  
5. Precision spraying mission  
6. Data logging & visualization
